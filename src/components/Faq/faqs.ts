        question: "What do I need to book a car on Top Down?",
        answer: "To book a car on Top Down, you must create a Top Down account, be 23 years old or older with a valid driver’s license, and get approved to drive on Top Down. When you’re booking your first trip, you’ll go through a quick approval process by entering your driver’s license and some other information. In most cases, you’ll get approved immediately, and you’ll be set for every future road trip, business trip, and family vacation!",

        question: "Do I need my own insurance?",
        answer: "No, you don’t need personal insurance coverage to book a car on Top Down in Canada. But, any personal insurance you may have that covers damage to the host’s vehicle would kick in before your Top Down protection plan, except when you select the Premier Plan.",
    },
    {
        question: "Can other people drive a car that I booked?",
        answer: "Yes, multiple guests can drive the car you book on Top Down, as long as they are all approved to drive. The primary driver (whoever booked the car) can add additional drivers with no fees or additional charges. Only the primary driver can request to add drivers; Top Down hosts cannot do it for you. We encourage you to request to add additional drivers before your trip starts, though guests in the US and Canada can request to add a driver while a trip is in progress.",

        question: "What is the cancellation policy on Top Down?",
        answer: "You can cancel and get a full refund up to 24 hours before your trip starts. If you book a trip with less than 24 hours’ notice, you have one hour after booking to cancel free of charge. If you cancel after the free cancellation period ends, you will be charged a small cancellation fee.",
